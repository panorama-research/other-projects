# Other Panorama Projects

There are a number of open source projects that are being developed within the [Panorama Research Project](https://panorama-research.org) but are not hosted in this organisation. You can find links to them below.

## Eclipse APP4MC

https://eclipse.org/app4mc

Eclipse APP4MC is a platform for engineering embedded multi- and many-core software systems. The platform enables the creation and management of complex tool chains including simulation and validation. As an open platform, proven in the automotive sector by Bosch and their partners, it supports interoperability and extensibility and unifies data exchange in cross-organizational projects. 

## Eclipse Capra

https://eclipse.org/capra

Eclipse Capra is a traceability management tool that is hosted by the Eclipse Modeling project. Capra allows the creation of trace links between arbitrary artefacts and provides features to edit them, keep them consistent, and visualise the relationships between them. This includes traceability matrices and graph visualisations that are helpful for change impact analysis and reporting.
